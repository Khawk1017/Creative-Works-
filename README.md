## Creative Works By Kameron Hawk

# Description
**Creative Works** is the name that I have selected to use for the title of my website. Given the assignment we were tasked to create a portfolio styled webage that detailed the work that I have done as a developer as well as a section to that contained contact information. 


# Code documentation
With my attempt to recreate the mock up I :
- Added a currrent picture of myself by using the  img html tag 
- Inserted a background image and the head of my webpage to contained the title as well as the naviagton links for the topics
-  with the four topic sections that I have on my webpage they all are using the same css atrribute of (display: flex;) (flex: basis;) and other css styles so that each topic is displayed on the left hand side of the page with a descriptive detail on the right hand side.
- each navigational link should at the top of the webpage should be accessible to click and jump to the labeled section on the site.
- basic footer containing copywright information located at the bottom of the webpage
- @media query with a max width of 600px which is a average screen size for smartphones so that they display would reamin tbhe same when viewing from a different device.
